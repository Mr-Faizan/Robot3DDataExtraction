    Description "\nThe robots can be programmed in the programming tab. In t\
he case of conceptual layouts, the robots can utilize robot controllers to a\
utomatically perform tasks.\nAll the robots have a similar component structu\
re and therefore they mostly support same features and they are easily repla\
ceable with each other.\n\n### How to use – Program tab ###\nMove the robo\
t with the “Jog” tool and create the motion statements in the “Program\
 Editor”. The created statements will have configurable properties as well\
.\nFor grasping/releasing products, changing tools, and other actions., see \
the “Signal Actions” and “Actions Configurations” properties for fur\
ther customization.\n\n### How to use – Robot Controller ###\nRobot contro\
llers, such as, “Process Modeling Robot Controller” component can be use\
d to automate robot programming. See our academy lessons for further instruc\
tions.\n\n### How to use – OLP ###\nWe provide post-processors and pre-pro\
cessors for continuously expanding group of robot vendors in our forum. In a\
ddition, we have some advanced robot statements available in the forum.\n\n#\
## Key Properties ###\nExecutor::IsEnabled = Determines if the robot is turn\
ed ON / OFF\nExecutor::IsLooping = Determines if the robot program is looped\
 when the program is run in programming tab\n    "
